# Van_Rental_Fortune_Telling
Time series dataset used to predict van rental sales demand.

<!-- #region -->
# BackGround

A National Van Rental companyâ€™s has expenses that are variables based on demand. The largest and most volatile expense is the fleet cost. If the fleet is too large, then massive quantities of car notes are paid on unused vans. If the fleet is too small, then revenues and market share are lossed.


## Questions to solve this business problem: 

- What are the peak Days? Weeks? Months? Quarters? Season?
- What are the slow periods? How long do they last?
- How often is the company under fleeted?
- How often is the company over fleeted?
- Can the company optimize fleeting patterns?


## Goals

- Build an accurate model to predict van rental sales demand.
- Help the Van Rental company optimize variable expenses.
